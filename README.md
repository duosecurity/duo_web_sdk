**duo_web_sdk** - Provides the [Duo Web Javascript](https://duo.com/docs/duoweb) in an ES6 module format that can be installed via npm/yarn and bundled into your web application.

## Installation

Install `duo_web_sdk` from Github: 

- With NPM: `npm install https://github.com/duosecurity/duo_web_sdk.git --save`
- With yarn: `yarn add https://github.com/duosecurity/duo_web_sdk.git`
- For development: `npm install`

## Usage

Basic usage would be importing this module and initializing the Duo Authentication Prompt
with the signed request passed from the server. The user would authenticate using the prompt, and you would
submit the signed response to your backend for verification. 

```js
import DuoWebSDK from 'duo_web_sdk';

DuoWebSDK.init({
  iframe: "duo-frame",
  host: host,
  sig_request: sigRequestPassedFromServer,
  submit_callback: someCallback,
});
```

See the examples folder for a full implementation using React and Express.

## Testing

```
$ npm test
```
